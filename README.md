# Medieval Irish

The [graph](http://ancatmara.github.io/old_irish_project/) shows the co-occurrence of characters in the Ulster cycle (31 text from [this corpus](https://github.com/ancatmara/old_irish_corpora/tree/master/ulster/lemmatized)). 

Each node corresponds to a character.
If two characters are connected with a link, they are mentioned together in a window of a size 10. The link’s thickness indicates how often they are mentioned together.
The size of the node shows how frequent the character is mentioned.
Double click on the node shows only the selected character’s connections. Single click brings the whole graph back.
