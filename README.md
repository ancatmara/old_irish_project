# Medieval Irish

The [graph](http://ancatmara.github.io/old_irish_project/) shows the co-occurrence of characters in the Ulster cycle (31 text from [this corpus](https://github.com/ancatmara/old_irish_corpora/tree/master/ulster/lemmatized)). 

Every circle (node) corresponds to a character: the bigger it is, the more frequently a character is mentioned. Characters marked with the same colour occur with the same frequency. The names of the characters are shown in pop-up text. 

If two characters are connected with a link, it means that they occur together in a window of size 10. The wider the link, the more often the characters co-occur.
